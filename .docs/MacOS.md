## Installing .NET Runtime

Please follow the [instructions provided here](Dotnet.md).

## Downloading and using DiscordChatExporter.Cli

1. Download [DiscordChatExporter.CLI.zip](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/releases/latest) and extract it to a folder.
2. Search for `Terminal.app` in Spotlight (âŒ˜+SPACE), then open it.
3. In the Terminal window, type `cd` , press the SPACE key, then drag and drop the extracted folder into the window, then press the RETURN key.
4. Execute the following command to export, replacing `TOKEN` and `CHANNEL` with your own values:

```console
./DiscordChatExporter.Cli.sh export -t TOKEN -c CHANNEL
```

If the above command throws a "Permission denied" error, use `chmod` to fix the permissions:

```console
chmod +x DiscordChatExporter.Cli.sh
```

Alternatively, if the script doesn't work, you can run the following command to run the application directly:

```console
dotnet DiscordChatExporter.Cli.dll export -t TOKEN -c CHANNEL
```
